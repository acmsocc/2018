  title: 'Building the warehouse scale computer'
  abstract: "Imagine some product team inside Google wants 100,000 CPU cores + RAM + flash + accelerators + disk in a couple of months. 
  We need to decide where to put them, when; whether to deploy new machines, or re-purpose/reconfigure old ones; ensure we have 
  enough power, cooling, networking, physical racks, data centers and (over longer a time-frame) wind power; cope with variances 
  in delivery times from supply logistics hiccups; do multi-year cost-optimal placement+decisions in the face of literally 
  thousands of different machine configurations; keep track of parts; schedule repairs, upgrades, and installations; and 
  generally make all this happen behind the scenes at minimum cost. And then after breakfast, we get to dynamically allocate resources 
  (on the small-minutes timescale) to the product groups that need them most urgently, accurately reflecting the cost 
  (opex/capex) of all the machines and infrastructure we just deployed, and monitoring and controlling the datacenter power 
  and cooling systems to achieve minimum overheads - even as we replace all of these on the fly. This talk will highlight some of 
  the exciting problems we're working on inside Google to ensure we can supply the needs of an organization that is experiencing 
  (literally) exponential growth in computing capacity."
  bio1: "John Wilkes has been at Google since 2008, where he is working on automation for building warehouse scale computers. 
  Before that, he spent a long time at HP Labs, becoming an HP and ACM Fellow in 2002.  He is interested in far too many 
  aspects of distributed systems, but a recurring theme has been technologies that allow systems to manage themselves. 
  In his spare time he continues, stubbornly, trying to learn how to blow glass."

  abstract: "Big Data comes in many shapes and sizes. Today's varieties of Big Data include Big Tabular Data."
  bio1:"Michael J. Carey received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Carnegie-Mellon University and his Ph.D. from the 
  University of California, Berkeley, in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively."
#  bio1: "Gustavo Alonso is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zürich. He studied telecommunications -electrical engineering- at the 
#  Madrid Technical University (ETSIT, Politécnica de Madrid). As a Fulbright scholar, he completed an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science 
#  at UC Santa Barbara. After graduating from Santa Barbara, he worked at the IBM Almaden Research Center before joining ETHZ. 
#  His research interests encompass almost all aspects of systems, from design to run time. He works on distributed systems, 
#  data processing, and system aspects of programming languages. Most of his research these days is related to multi-core architectures, 
#  data centers, FPGAs, and hardware acceleration. Gustavo has received numerous awards for his research, including three Test-of-Time 
#  awards for work in databases, programming languages, and systems. He is a Fellow of the ACM and of the IEEE."
